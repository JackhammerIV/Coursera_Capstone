Restaurateur, Jr. to help plan his next restaurant location. The client is the Chairman and CEO of a multi-million dollar restaurant conglomerate that spans 40 countries and 1000 restaurants. The client is looking to expand their restaurant offerings to the university student market, with a pilot restaurant in Chicago planned to launch in 2022. \n\nThe client typically undertakes traditional market research through surveys and on-site visits before deciding on a new restaurant. However, Mr Jus A. Restaurateur, Jr. has taken interest in data science and how it could improve his business. Our company has won the tender to provide a research report as part of the client's initial investigation of potential opportunities that can be uncovered by data science. \n\nThe initial target market is the University of Illinois at Chicago. This report will investigate the existing restaurant offerings in the local area and provide recommendations to the client on segments of the market that are highly competitive as well as potential opportunities in underserved segments. Our company sees this as an opportunity to further prove our data science expertise to deliver actionable insights to our clientele. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Only Foursquare data will be used for this report. Foursquare is a search-and-discovery mobile app launched in 2009 that provides local recommendations of the top venues (such as restaurants, bars, theatres, parks) in an area. User reviews are captured and provide ratings for the locations. Our initial research has suggested that students at the University of Illinois at Chicago are avid users of Foursquare. Thus, we view this data source as providing key insights into the preferences of the target market.\n\nOur proposed approach is to investigate the area up to 3 kilometres around the University of Illinois at Chicago, which roughly corresponds to a 20-30 minute walking distance. We will use the category definitions provided by Foursquare to examine the existing restaurant offerings and identify the highly competitive categories as well as underserved categories."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
